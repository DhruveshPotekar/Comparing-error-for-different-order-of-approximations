# Error-comparison-using-different-degrees-of-order-for-same-grid-size
In this we are going to compare the error generated due to different order of approximations.\

The function is\

I used the 1st, 2nd and 4th order of approximation for the above mentioned function.\
The computation of the function was done at x=pi/3 and gridspace of dx= pi/20.\

The Result is\

From the result we can clearly see that for the same gridspace(dx) the error decreases as we use higher order approximation methods.
